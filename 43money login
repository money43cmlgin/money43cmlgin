Previous Pew research found that payday loan borrowers want regulatory action to reform payday lending and expand lower-cost credit options, so in light of the CFPB proposal, Pew conducted a new nationally representative survey of 826 borrowers and found that:

70 percent of borrowers believe payday loans should be more regulated.
 Support for requiring installment payment structures is strong. Three in 4 borrowers say having several months to repay and doing so in smaller installments would be major improvements, but most say additional underwriting would not.
 Borrowersâ€™ priorities for reform include lower prices, affordable payments, and being able to obtain small loans from banks and credit unions.
8 in 10 would prefer to borrow from a bank or credit union if they were equally likely to be approved, and 90 percent would do so if the loans cost six times less than those of payday lenders. The pricing differential is based on payday lender fees for loans and on prices financial institutions would reportedly offer.
Virtually all would choose loans that cost six times less. Ninety-two percent of borrowers say they would prefer the lower-cost credit that banks and credit unions would likely offer under the 5 percent payment option. Only 5 percent would opt for more expensive payday installment loans that went through the proposed ability-to-repay origination process.
